# Komodo CLI

Komodo CLI is a tool to execute actions on your Komodo instance from shell scripts.

## Install

```sh
cargo install komodo_cli
```

Note: On Ubuntu, also requires `apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev`.

## Usage

### Credentials

Configure a file `~/.config/komodo/creds.toml` file with contents:
```toml
url = "https://your.komodo.address"
key = "YOUR-API-KEY"
secret = "YOUR-API-SECRET"
```

Note. You can specify a different creds file by using `--creds ./other/path.toml`.
You can also bypass using any file and pass the information using `--url`, `--key`, `--secret`:

```sh
komodo --url "https://your.komodo.address" --key "YOUR-API-KEY" --secret "YOUR-API-SECRET" ...
```

### Run Executions

```sh
# Triggers an example build
komodo execute run-build test_build
```
